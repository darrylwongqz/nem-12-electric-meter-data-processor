1. Create a file analyzer service that determines optimal chunking strategy.
2. Develop a coordinator service that manages the map-reduce process.
3. Implement worker-to-worker communication for progress reporting.
4. Add metrics collection for performance optimization.

### State Management

**Current Implementation**:
The frontend uses a mix of React state and context for managing application state. This works well for smaller applications but can become unwieldy as complexity grows.

**Improved Approach**:
1. **Centralized State**: Implement a more robust state management solution like Redux Toolkit or Zustand.
2. **State Normalization**: Normalize state to avoid duplication and consistency issues.
3. **Selector Pattern**: Use memoized selectors for derived state.

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Define a normalized state schema.
2. Implement action creators and reducers for state transitions.
3. Add middleware for side effects (API calls, etc.).
4. Create a persistence layer with selective state saving.

### Error Handling

**Current Implementation**:
Error handling is somewhat inconsistent across the application, with different approaches in different components.

**Improved Approach**:
1. **Error Boundary Pattern**: Implement React error boundaries at strategic points.
2. **Centralized Error Logging**: Create a unified error logging service.
3. **User-Friendly Error Messages**: Map technical errors to user-friendly messages.
4. **Recovery Strategies**: Define clear recovery paths for different error types.

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Develop an error mapping service that translates error codes to messages.
2. Create standardized error handling hooks for React components.
3. Implement a central error logging service with severity levels.
4. Add automatic retry logic for transient errors.

### API Design

**Current Implementation**:
The API follows REST principles but lacks some consistency in resource naming and response formats.

**Improved Approach**:
1. **Resource-Oriented Design**: Stricter adherence to resource-oriented REST principles.
2. **Consistent Response Format**: Standardized response envelope for all endpoints.
3. **Hypermedia Controls**: Add HATEOAS links for better API discoverability.
4. **Versioning Strategy**: Implement explicit API versioning.

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Create an API style guide with naming conventions and patterns.
2. Develop middleware for response formatting.
3. Add hypermedia link generation to response handlers.
4. Implement a versioning strategy in URL or headers.

### Performance Optimization

**Current Implementation**:
Performance optimizations are applied in various places but lack systematic measurement and validation.

**Improved Approach**:
1. **Performance Budgets**: Set explicit performance budgets for key metrics.
2. **Instrumentation**: Add comprehensive performance instrumentation.
3. **Caching Strategy**: Implement a multi-level caching strategy.
4. **Resource Optimization**: Systematically optimize assets and dependencies.

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Define key performance indicators and measurement methods.
2. Implement instrumentation for server and client-side performance.
3. Develop a caching layer with cache invalidation strategies.
4. Set up CI/CD checks for performance regressions.
